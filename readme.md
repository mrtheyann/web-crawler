### simple web crawler
task for an university class of basics of web parsing

I decide to use:
Python 3.6, requests, BeautifulSoup, lxml

Primary target:
[Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com)

output is a csv file:
`name : value`

```Bitcoin (BTC),$1150.53

Ethereum Classic (ETC),$2.79```

#### this script behavior is very straightforward so the modern sites would probably ban you for such a parsing
